        <p>When present in maps, the <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element is associated with
            <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> elements. This enables map authors to accomplish the
          following goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Associate a short description with a non-DITA object.</li>
          <li>Provide a short description that is specific to the map context and used for link
            previews.</li>
          <li>Override the short description located in the associated DITA topic, when the
              <xmlatt>copy-to</xmlatt> attribute is specified. Processors might not implement this
              behavior.<p>When a <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element applies to an entire
              DITA map, it serves as description only.</p></li>

        they <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD</term> use the content of the
