                  <p>The <xmlelement>ph</xmlelement> element often is used to enclose a phrase for
                        reuse or conditional processing.</p>
                  <p>The <xmlelement>ph</xmlelement> element frequently is used as a specialization
                        base, to create phrase-level markup that can provide additional semantic
                        meaning or trigger specific processing or formatting. For example, all
                        highlighting domain elements are specializations of
                              <xmlelement>ph</xmlelement>.</p>
